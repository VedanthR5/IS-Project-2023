# Independent Study Project 2023

## Project Overview
This independent study project explores the realm of neural networks and AI algorithms with a focus on detecting skin cancer. The project is divided into two main units, each addressing different aspects of AI and machine learning.

## Project Units

### Unit 1: Identifying Handwritten Digits
In this unit, we delve into the fundamentals of AI and machine learning by building a system to identify handwritten digits. This unit serves as a foundational step in understanding neural networks and their applications.

### Unit 2: Creating a Backpropagation Algorithm with Seeds Dataset
The second unit is dedicated to creating and implementing a backpropagation algorithm. Using the Seeds dataset, we develop an AI model that can learn and make predictions. This unit provides hands-on experience in training AI algorithms for specific tasks.

## Harvard CS50 Course
Throughout this project, we draw inspiration from the Harvard CS50 course, which covers a wide range of AI-related concepts and techniques. Some of the key topics we explore in the course include:

- **Search**: Finding optimal solutions to problems, such as route planning and game strategies.
- **Knowledge**: Representing information and drawing inferences from it.
- **Uncertainty**: Dealing with uncertain events using probability.
- **Optimization**: Finding the most efficient solutions to problems.
- **Learning**: Improving performance based on data and experience.
- **Neural Networks**: Exploring AI structures inspired by the human brain.
- **Language**: Natural language processing for communication and understanding.

## Project Progress
This repository contains code, datasets, and documentation related to the independent study project. You will find details on the implementation of AI algorithms, datasets used, and explanations of the concepts explored in the Harvard CS50 course.

Feel free to explore the project and engage with the code and documentation to gain a deeper understanding of AI and neural networks.
